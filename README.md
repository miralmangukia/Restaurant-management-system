# Restaurant-management-system
The Restaurant Management System project is designed to handle and organize critical operations of a restaurant, including managing menu categories, items, departments, and employee records. By leveraging the power of SQL databases, this system offers structured and efficient data management solutions for restaurant operations.
This database design supports key functionalities like managing employee details, job roles, hierarchical departments, and menu offerings across multiple categories. It also facilitates operations like querying menu details, employee payroll information, and department structures using SQL commands.

Key Features:
Database Tables:

MenuCategory: Manages categories like starters, drinks, main courses, and desserts.
Menu: Maintains detailed records of menu items with attributes such as item name, price, and category.
Department: Stores information about operational departments such as catering, sanitation, and maintenance.
Employee: Holds employee data, including names, salaries, roles, and assigned departments.
Functional Queries:

Efficient data retrieval using SELECT, WHERE, and JOIN statements.
Complex queries involving grouping (GROUP BY) and filtering (HAVING).
Data insertion (INSERT), modification (UPDATE), and deletion (DELETE).
Constraints to enforce data integrity (e.g., price > 0, age > 18).
Subqueries and aggregate functions (MAX, MIN, COUNT) for advanced data analysis.
Advanced SQL Operations:

Table alteration and schema evolution using ALTER TABLE.
Data filtering through conditional logic (IN, LIKE, BETWEEN).
Data aggregation, summarization, and employee performance reports.
Data security and role-based query optimization for user-specific operations.
Sample Use Cases:
Menu Management:

Retrieve the list of all menu items under a specific category.
Update the price of an item when required.
Employee Operations:

Get a list of employees earning above a certain threshold.
Identify employees assigned to specific departments.
Departmental Insights:

Analyze payroll distribution across departments.
Fetch department details for employee organization.
Performance Reports:

Identify employees with the longest service duration.
Aggregate salary data across departments.
Technologies Used:
Database: MySQL
SQL Features: DDL (Data Definition Language), DML (Data Manipulation Language), DQL (Data Query Language), and TCL (Transaction Control Language) commands.
Future Enhancements:
Integration with a front-end UI for better user interaction.
Role-based access control for secure data management.
Analytics for sales and employee performance.
Real-time reporting and dashboard visualization.
This project provides a foundational approach to understanding SQL database design and practical implementation in a real-world restaurant scenario.
